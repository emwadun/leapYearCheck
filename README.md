# leapYearCheck

Three criteria must be taken into account to identify leap years:
1. The year must be evenly divisible by 4;
2. If the year can also be evenly divided by 100, it is not a leap year;
unless...
3. The year is also evenly divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year.

The complete list of leap years in the first half of the 21st century is therefore:
2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016, 2020, 2024, 2028, 2032, 2036, 2040, 2044, and 2048.

I have used the above three criteria to determine if a year input by the user is a leap year.

A function leapYearCheck() has been used.
